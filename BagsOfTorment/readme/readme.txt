Overview
~~~~~~~~

A mod for Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition.

This mod adds a number of containers to the game which can be purchased from various shops.
One of the containers may also trigger a small quest.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive 
into your game directory and run "setup-BagsOfTorment.exe".

Note:
PST:EE patch version 3.1.4 and earlier contains a bug that will reset modded content whenever the
party enters or resets the Modron Maze. To work around this issue, it is strongly recommended to
download and install Generalized Biffing (https://github.com/SpellholdStudios/generalized_biffing/releases/latest)
as the final mod in the mod list.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Containers for PST:EE (main component)

Installs the following containers:
- Imp Leather Bag:        Can be purchased from a merchant at the marketplace in the Hive. 
                          May store up to 50 items.
- Modron Storage Crystal: Can be looted from the Evil Wizard Construct in the Modron Maze.
                          Hint: Killing the construct quickly might pay off in an unexpected way.
                          May store up to 200 items.
- Pocket Singularity:     An exotic item that can be purchased from Vrischika's "Curiosity Shoppe" 
                          at Clerk's Ward. You'll have to figure out how to make it work first.
                          May store up to 500 items.


2. Increase storage capacity of containers (requires main component)

This tweak increases the original storage capacity to over 32000.
